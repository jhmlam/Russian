# Introduction
The russian alphabet is called cyrillic. Very mixed - greek, older greek, hebrew, orientals; and different slavs in different parts of the world added more and more until it settled in Russia at 34 letters in modern time. See [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet#/media/File:Historical_evolution_of_the_Russian_Cyrillic_alphabet,_until_the_19th_century_(Grech).jpg).

# Fonts and Pronunciation
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_alphabet
* `The Cyrillic alphabet and Russian spelling generally employ fewer diacritics than those used in other European languages written with the Latin alphabet. The only diacritic, in the proper sense, is the acute accent `/` (Russian: знак ударения 'mark of stress')`

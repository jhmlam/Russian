# Keyboard

As language learners, we will only use the phonetic keyboard on your computer (basically this means your american laptop...). Here is a summary of 2023 from Annie Platoff.
* Windows 8,10 and 11 have a phonetic keyboard though some alphabet needs keybindings e.g. ch and sh
* Windows 8 Steps
```
• Go to Settings > Control Panel > Clock, Language, and Region
• Pick “Language” > Click on “Add a Language”
• Pick “Russian” > Then pick “Add an input method”
• Select the “Russian – Mnemonic” keyboard
```
* Windows 10 & Windows 11 Steps
```
• Windows Start > Settings > Time & Language > Language & Region [Language]
• “Add a language” [“Add a preferred language”]. Search for “Russian”, select “Русский”, and 
click “Next”
• Install the language pack, but DO NOT check the box to set it as your display language.
• Select “Русский” > right-hand dot menu – “Language Options” [“Options” button] > Click on “Add a keyboard” NOTE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT STEPS
